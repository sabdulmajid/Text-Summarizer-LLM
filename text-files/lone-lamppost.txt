The lone lamppost in the one-street town flickered, casting a dim light on the deserted street. A woman stood by the side of the road, her suitcase at her feet. She was hitchhiking, and she had been waiting for a car for hours. She was tired and hungry, but she was determined to get out of this town. Finally, a car came down the street. The woman raised her arm and waved, and the car pulled over. She got in and gave the driver her destination. The car started driving, and the woman leaned back in her seat and closed her eyes. She was finally on her way.
