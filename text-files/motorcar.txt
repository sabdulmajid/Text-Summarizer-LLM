I have procured a motorcar in Las Vegas and have secured lodgings at the Twentynine Palms Inn, which lies just north of Joshua Tree. We shall travel from Las Vegas through the Mojave National Preserve and may undertake a brief hike en route. Then, we shall spend the entire day on Monday at Joshua Tree. The following morning, we may determine whether we wish to explore Joshua Tree or the Mojave further before returning.
